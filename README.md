#### Note:
This is an old project of mine that I recently revamped a bit for publishing. It includes a custom Perlin Noise implementation 
for some odd reason instead of using Unity's built-in one. *I don't remember if I wrote said implementation myself*, so please 
let me know if you find out it's from someone else.
